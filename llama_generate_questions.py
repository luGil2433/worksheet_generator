RULES:
- ONLY output clean \\item entries in LaTeX enumerate format.
- Every math/science/technical expression must be wrapped inside inline math mode using \\( ... \\) if applicable.
- Avoid Unicode symbols like √, ∫, etc. Always use LaTeX syntax (\sqrt{{}}, \int, etc.).
- Never nest \\( \\( ... \\) \\).
- Do NOT write explanations or extra sentences outside the questions.

Example output format:

\\item What is the capital of France?
\\item Solve for \\( x \\) in \\( 2x + 5 = 15 \\)
\\item Name two causes of the American Revolution.

ONLY output the list of \\item entries.
