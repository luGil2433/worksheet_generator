Answer the following questions carefully.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The original chicken nugget recipe was developed in the 1950s by whom? \vspace{2cm} \item If a box of chicken nuggets from 1965 contained $ \frac{2}{3} $ more pieces than one from 1975, how many pieces would you expect to find in each box? \vspace{2cm} \item Assuming an average American consumes $ 1.25 $ pounds of chicken nuggets per year, what is the total amount of chicken nuggets consumed annually by a population of $ 331,449,281 $? \vspace{2cm} \item A company claims that their new chicken nugget recipe uses only $ \frac{1}{5} $ the amount of preservatives as previous recipes. If the old recipe used $ 12 $ grams of preservatives per serving, how many grams would be used in the new recipe? \vspace{2cm} \item Plot the graph of $ y = (0.2x + 3)^2 $ to visualize the growth of chicken nugget sales from $ 1985 $ to $ 2010 $. \vspace{2cm} \item Determine the median value of the following data set: \[ \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline Year & Sales \\ \hline 1985 & 10 \\ 1990 & 15 \\ 1995 & 20 \\ 2000 & 25 \\ 2005 & 30 \\ 2010 & 35 \\ \hline \end{array} \] \vspace{2cm} \item If a chicken nugget costs $ \$1.50 $ and you buy $ 4 $ boxes, how much will you spend in total? \vspace{2cm} \item Sketch the graph of $ y = \ln(x + 2) $ to analyze the change in consumer behavior towards chicken nuggets from $ 1990 $ to $ 2015 $. \vspace{2cm} \item Assuming a box of chicken nuggets contains $ \frac{1}{3} $ more pieces than a serving size, and a serving size is defined as $ 4 $ pieces, how many pieces would you expect to find in a box? \vspace{2cm} \item Compare the nutritional value of original chicken nuggets from $ 1980 $ to those from $ 2020 $. \vspace{2cm}
